# If all lights are off, turn them on. Otherwise, turn them off.
# Description: 
# 1. The first condition checks if all lights are off. If this condition is true, it turns on all lights.
# 2. If not all lights are off (i.e., any light is on), it proceeds to the default block, which turns off all lights.
